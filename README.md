# Simple-Classifier-by-back-propatation
Implementing a simple classifier by numpy
## Introduction
This code mainly implements a simple classifier by numpy. SVM loss (hinge loss) function is used in this classifier, and we use back propagation (chain rule) algorithm to update the Weights and bias. 
## Data
Five Windows font are used to validate the classifier, Figures are as follow:
